# Lab Session: Week 3 - Edge detection

In this lab exercise, you will look at applying edge detectors to images and comparing two different methods. You will also learn how to write a function in Python and evaluate the difference when using an approximation for the calculation of a parameter.

At this stage, we will assume that you are able to use Python, and understand its basic use. **You are asked to write a short (no more than 2 pages) report of your work, answering specific questions, and showing example images.** This work is not assessed (it will not count towards your module mark) but you will get formative feedback.
